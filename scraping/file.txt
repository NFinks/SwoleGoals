One-Arm Dumbbell Row	Strength	Middle Back	Dumbbell	Beginner	9	 1. Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. 2. Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. 3. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. 4. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. 5. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. 6. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions. 7. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.	https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/13/Male/m/13_2.jpg	https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/13/Male/m/13_1.jpg

Clean and Jerk	Olympic Weightlifting	Shoulders	Barbell	Expert	9.3	 1. With a barbell on the floor close to the shins, take an overhand or hook grip just outside the legs. Lower your hips with the weight focused on the heels, back straight, head facing forward, chest up, with your shoulders just in front of the bar. This will be your starting position. 2. Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees. 3. Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended. 4. As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery. 5. Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position. 6. The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible. 7. Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders. 8. At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.	https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/670/Male/m/670_1.jpg	https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/670/Male/m/670_3.jpg
